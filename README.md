# Leaderboard: setup project

## Learning objectives

- Use callbacks and promises.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.
- Use webpack to bundle JavaScript.


## Description

In this activity I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using *webpack* and *ES6* features, notably *modules*. I will develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript *async* and *await* and add some styling.


### General Good Practice 

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that I used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that I documented my work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).


### Project requirements


- Create an **npm project with webpack**. 
- Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because I will implement styles in the following steps. I'm Using this wireframe as a guide:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./leaderboard_wireframe.png" alt="Basic UI"  width="500px"/>
</p>

- I'm not making any API calls, this will be done on another activity branch

- I'm Using ES6 modules, with *import* and *export*.

### Setup the Project
you can clone this repos by typing in your console:
````
git clone git@github.com:Anvi98/Leadboard.git
